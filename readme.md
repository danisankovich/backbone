Backbone is a lightweight library for structuring javascript code

mvc: an architectural pattern for implementing user interfaces.
3 components: model, view, controller

Backbone views are like controllers. (hence why it is an MV)

Routers for single page applications.All necessary code received initially, speeding up user experience. (like gmail)

Backbone vs Angular: none inherently better. Each designed for a different purpose.

5 components in Backbone:
events: to add an object the ability to publish/subscribe to events
Models: application data
Collections: a set of Models
Views: to render models and listen for DOM/model events
Routers: to create single page applications

basic structure:
on server, have a restful apis.
views render the models.
